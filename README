This is EPL version 0.2.  EPL (Emacs Perl) is a replacement for
Perlmacs that uses pipes instead of embedding.  This allows it to work
with different Emacs, XEmacs, and Perl versions without
recompilation.  See http://john-edwin-tobey.org/perlmacs/ for news and
the latest version.

This is ALPHA software.  It is incomplete, not accurately documented,
and mostly untested.  USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Currently, EPL requires at least Emacs 21 or XEmacs 21(?) and Perl
5.005.  I hope to get these numbers down a bit.


INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Copy the Lisp files from the elisp directory to where Emacs looks for
libraries.  Load them in Emacs with `load-file' or the `-l' command
line option.  Refer to the Emacs manual for details about loading
libraries.

See the Emacs::Lisp documentation for further information.
