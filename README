This is EPL version 0.3.  EPL (Emacs Perl) is a replacement for
Perlmacs that uses pipes instead of embedding.  This allows it to work
with different Emacs, XEmacs, and Perl versions without
recompilation.  See http://john-edwin-tobey.org/perlmacs/ for news and
the latest version.

  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
  General Public License for more details.

EPL requires at least Perl 5.005 and prefers 5.6.0.  It is known to
work with Emacs 20 and XEmacs 21, but with the caveat that Lisp
references to Perl data must be freed explicitly or result in a memory
leak.  Under GNU Emacs 21, this restriction will not exist.


INSTALLATION

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

Copy the Lisp files from the elisp directory to where Emacs looks for
libraries.  Load perl.el in Emacs with `M-x load-file' or the
equivalent.  Refer to the Emacs manual for details about loading
libraries.

See the Emacs::Lisp documentation for further information.
